# Cl-Cd_plotter
possess the ability to plot Cl/Cd -α graph or Cl/Cd-Cl graph (the latter is more useful when comparing different airfoils)
use the output file of Xfoil of a specific airfoil as the input file of these programs
the output will be Cl/Cd -α graph for Cl_Cd_plotter.py and Cl/Cd-Cl graph for Cld_Cl_plotter.py
